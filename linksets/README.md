### Ondertrouwregisters - ECARTICO
ECARTICO is a curated biographical dataset on persons, but does not yet refer to the (new) URIs of persons in documents in the Amsterdam City Archives. This linkset matches the person URIs of Ondertrouw (=Marriage) deeds to the URIs of persons in ECARTICO through name, partner name, and marriage date.

### Ja, ik wil! - Ondertrouwregisters
These datasets have indexed the same original source. The JIW dataset even started with a copy of the SAA data, but diverted and lost the relation to the original material completely. The connection to the source was already brought back in our Golden Agents version. With this linkset, we also link between the indexed persons. This is only done for the bride and groom roles, and the earlier wife and earlier husband roles. The witness role is not available in the OTR data.
